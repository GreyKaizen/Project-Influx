Using the Concepts of OOP Paradigm to Create a Virtual Marketplace to Sell and Buy Items

Project Overview:

The Console-based Market Place is a platform that connects buyers and sellers in
a virtual market place. The platform will allow buyers to browse through various
shops and purchase items from the comfort of their homes. The shops will be able
to showcase their products, manage their inventory and receive orders from the
buyers. The platform will utilize the concepts of OOP paradigm like inheritance,
abstractions, encapsulation, and polymorphism to provide a seamless experience
for both buyers and sellers.
